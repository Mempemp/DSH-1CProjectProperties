# Ordinary forms — `Form.bin`

**An ordinary form is not XML.** In a Designer file export a managed form writes
`Forms/<Имя>/Ext/Form.xml`; an ordinary form writes `Forms/<Имя>/Ext/Form.bin` — a
1C container holding two payload entries: `form` (the layout, a brace tree) and
`module` (the form module, BSL). The sidecar `Forms/<Имя>.xml` declares which model
it is, via `<FormType>Ordinary</FormType>`.

Find them with `**/Forms/*/Ext/Form.bin`. A form whose `Form.xml` appears to be
"missing" is almost always an ordinary form, not a broken export.

### The MCP contract — `ordinary-form/1`

The same two tools, with the same arguments and the same result payload, are
published by **`1c-code-metadata-mcp`** and **`1c-graph-metadata-mcp`**. Learn them
once. On the graph server the payload arrives in the envelope's `data` section; on
the code server it is the result itself.

#### `unpack_ordinary_form`

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `form_path` | — | The `Form.bin` to read. Absolute path; Cyrillic is normal. |
| `workspace_path` | — | Where to materialise the workspace. New, empty, or a workspace this tool wrote. |
| `overwrite` | `false` | Replace an existing workspace **of this contract**. A non-empty directory the tool did not write is refused whatever this says. |
| `include` | `"summary"` | Which bounded preview to embed: `summary` (paths only), `structure`, `module`, `all`. |
| `max_chars` | `4000` | Bound on each embedded preview (server cap 20 000). |

Result: `status`, `contract`, `tool`, `workspace_path`, `manifest_path`, `source`
(`path` / `size` / `sha256`), `container`, `entries`, `entries_truncated`, `notes`,
`warnings` — plus `structure` / `structure_truncated` and `module_text` /
`module_truncated` when `include` asks for them. Each entry carries `name`, `kind`
(`brace_tree` / `bsl_module` / `text` / `container` / `binary`), `size`, `sha256`,
`encoding`, `deflated`, `path` and `decoded_path`.

#### `build_ordinary_form`

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace_path` | — | A workspace written by `unpack_ordinary_form`. |
| `output_path` | — | The `Form.bin` to write. Never replaced silently. |
| `overwrite` | `false` | Replace an existing output file. |
| `verify` | `true` | Re-read the result and compare the payload. Leave it on. |

Result: `status`, `contract`, `tool`, `workspace_path`, `output_path`, `output`
(`path` / `size` / `sha256`), `source`, `binary_identical`, `verified`,
`verification` (`match` / `mismatch` / `skipped`, with per-entry hashes),
`changed_entries`, `notes`.

#### Errors

A refusal is `status="error"` with an `error_code` and an actionable `hint`. The
codes: `dependency_missing`, `path_invalid`, `path_not_found`, `not_a_file`,
`not_a_container`, `unsupported_container_layout`, `workspace_not_empty`,
`workspace_exists`, `workspace_invalid`, `manifest_missing`, `manifest_invalid`,
`payload_missing`, `derived_edit_detected`, `output_exists`, `unpack_failed`,
`build_failed`, `verify_failed`.

### The workspace

```text
<workspace>/
  ordinary-form.json    # manifest: source, entries, hashes. Generated — never hand-edit.
  payload/
    form                # the layout brace tree, UTF-8 BOM + CRLF   <- SOURCE OF TRUTH
    module              # the form module, BSL, UTF-8 BOM + CRLF    <- SOURCE OF TRUTH
  decoded/
    form.json           # the layout as JSON-compatible data        <- derived, read-only
    module.bsl          # the module, for BSL tooling               <- derived, read-only
```

**Edit `payload/`.** `decoded/` is regenerated on every unpack and is never read
back. Editing a derived view and then building is refused with
`derived_edit_detected` rather than silently dropped — but only that refusal saves
the work, so do not rely on noticing.

### Workflow — edit an ordinary form

```powershell
# 1. Read it
unpack_ordinary_form(
    form_path="C:\src\Catalogs\Товары\Forms\Форма\Ext\Form.bin",
    workspace_path="C:\work\Форма")

# 2. Edit C:\work\Форма\payload\module (BSL) or payload\form (the layout tree).
#    Keep the UTF-8 BOM and the CRLF line endings.

# 3. Write it back, and prove nothing was lost
build_ordinary_form(
    workspace_path="C:\work\Форма",
    output_path="C:\src\Catalogs\Товары\Forms\Форма\Ext\Form.bin",
    overwrite=$true)
```

Check `verification.status == "match"`. Then load the export into the infobase the
normal way (`/update1cbase`) — this skill writes a file, it does not touch an
infobase.

Paths with spaces or Cyrillic go in double quotes, always. In PowerShell prefer
single-quoted literals (`'C:\src\...\Form.bin'`) when the path contains `$`.

### Warnings — read before the first call

- **`Form.bin` is a binary 1C container, not a document. Never edit it directly,
  never read it as XML, never open it with an XML tool.** A text editor corrupts
  it silently. It is *one* container: the reference ordinary form holds exactly two
  entries, `form` and `module`, stored verbatim. A file holding more than one
  container is a whole CF / CFE / EPF and is refused with
  `unsupported_container_layout`; an entry that is itself a container is kept whole
  rather than descended into, which is what keeps the round trip lossless.
- **Never Deflate the entries of a `Form.bin`.** 1C:Enterprise reads the `form` and
  `module` streams of a standalone ordinary form only as plain UTF-8 BOM text; a
  deflated stream is «Ошибка формата потока» and the thick client exits (observed on
  8.3.27.2074, in Designer and in Enterprise alike — a 728 KB form packed to 114 KB
  never opened again until it was repacked plain). Designer writes them plain.
  `build_ordinary_form` writes every entry plain whatever the manifest's `deflated`
  flag says (the flag records how the *source* stored the entry; a deflated source
  is reported in `warnings` on unpack and in `notes` on build). Do not "optimise"
  a `Form.bin` with any repacking tool's `-deflate` / `-pack` — the size it saves is
  the form it loses.
- **Do not judge a round trip by the final SHA-256.** `v8unpack` stamps container
  records with the current time, so a rebuilt `Form.bin` differs byte for byte from
  its source even when nothing changed. `binary_identical: false` together with
  `verification.status: "match"` is the **normal, correct** outcome. The equality
  that means "nothing was lost" is the logical payload — entry names, sizes and
  SHA-256 — which is what `verification` reports.
- **Preserve the workspace manifest and `payload/`.** They are what a build reads.
  A workspace without `ordinary-form.json` is not a workspace (`manifest_missing`),
  and a missing payload entry is refused (`payload_missing`) rather than built
  around.
- **A standalone `Form.bin` names nothing.** Its brace tree is positional: it is
  structurally parseable, and no token in it says "this is a button called X". Do
  not invent element names, types or handlers from it. Named element trees
  (`*.elem.json`) come from high-level CF / CFE / EPF extraction, where the
  surrounding metadata supplies the names — and even there v8unpack 1.2.6 writes a
  populated tree only for **managed** forms (see [Limitations](../SKILL.md#limitations)).
- **On Windows use `--processes 1`** for the CLI unless parallel processing has
  been validated for the artifact at hand. The MCP tools spawn no processes at all.
- **Nothing is overwritten silently.** An existing workspace needs
  `overwrite=true`; an existing output file needs `overwrite=true`; a non-empty
  directory the tool did not write is refused outright, `overwrite` or not.

### Which route for a form

| Situation | Route |
|---|---|
| One ordinary form, sources already on disk | `unpack_ordinary_form` / `build_ordinary_form` |
| Every form of a `.cf` / `.cfe` / `.epf` at once | CLI `-E`, then the per-form files it writes |
| The infobase is available and you want XML sources | `/getconfigfiles` — not this skill |
| A managed form (`Ext/Form.xml`) | `1c-metadata-manage` skill — not this skill |
